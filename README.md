# CS61A
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.  

CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. In CS 61A, I was taught about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. Thus the course included a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in the course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. I was also taught interpreters, which was followed with Regular Expressions, Backus-Naur Form, and the Scheme programming language.
